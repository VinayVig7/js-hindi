/*  
The Promise.all() method is one of the promise concurrency methods. It can be useful for aggregating the results of multiple promises. It is typically used when there are multiple related asynchronous tasks that the overall code relies on to work successfully â€” all of whom we want to fulfill before the code execution continues.

Promise.all() will reject immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting. In comparison, the promise returned by Promise.allSettled() will wait for all input promises to complete, regardless of whether or not one rejects. Use allSettled() if you need the final result of every promise in the input iterable.
